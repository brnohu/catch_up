We consider finite difference
implementation of local volatility models
when the underlying has a non-trivial drift.
For this case, we develop a finite difference
scheme that guarantees positive transition
probabilities and also handle the case where
the input option prices are not fully
arbitrage consistent. We include C++ code
for our finite difference solver.
